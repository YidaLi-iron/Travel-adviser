# Introduction
Travel Adviser is a website which can give user advices about destinations they want to go. The adviser will give user advices based on weather condition, distance, traveling ways, and carbon dioxide emissions. The reason I choose this topic is a lot of people have a few places they want to go to when they choose their vacation destinations. This adviser where help users to figure out which place is the best place to go at this time based on our logic. The sustainable development goal I address is climate action through control the emissions of carbon dioxide. The way I relate to this topic is when give users advise, we will consider emissions of carbon dioxide based on the way they travel and distance to that place.

# Current Version
In current version, I finished almost all the parts of travel adviser. When using the website, there are several things need to consider. The first one is three location you entered should in a same land. For example, you cannot enter London and New York at the same time. The second thing is you can only enter starting date within next seven days.
